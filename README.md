# Python Contact Manager

A simple contact saver program written in Python. I built this project using **Pydroid 3** on my Android phone while learning Python. The program stores contacts in memory during runtime and allows the user to:

- Save new contacts (name and 11-digit phone number)
- View all saved contacts
- Search for a contact by name or phone number
- Gracefully handle empty lists and invalid input

## Technologies
- Python (runs on Pydroid 3 or any standard Python 3 environment)

## How it works
The program keeps contacts in a list of tuples: `('Name', '08012345678')`. It uses simple functions to add, view and search contacts and runs in the console.

## How to run (Pydroid 3)
1. Open Pydroid 3 on your Android phone.
2. Create a new file named `contact_manager.py`.
3. Paste the code from `contact_manager.py` into that file and save.
4. Run the script inside Pydroid 3 (press run â–¶).

## How to run (PC)
1. Install Python 3 from https://python.org if not installed.
2. Save `contact_manager.py` to a folder.
3. Open terminal/cmd, navigate to the folder and run:
